        <h2>NS2 & NS3 Content:</h2>
        <p>NS2 and NS3 are widely used discrete-event network simulators for simulating various network protocols (TCP, UDP) and technologies wired, wireless, MANET. NS2 allows user to write scripts using C++ with OTcl and NS3 allows user to write scripts in C++ with optional python bindings. Most common NS2 projects are Routing Protocol, Wireless Sensor network, VANET, Congestion Control. Most common NS3 projects are LTE network simulation, Wi-Fi mesh network,5G network simulations, VoIP.  </p>
    </div>
    <div className='ns2ns3_main_div_2' data-aos="fade-down"data-aos-duration="2000">
        <h2>Key Components</h2>
        <p>Simulation Objects: NS2 uses a variety of objects to represent network entities, such as nodes (routers, hosts), links (connections), and protocols (TCP, UDP, etc.).</p>
        <p>Event Scheduler: NS2 operates on a discrete event model. It has an event scheduler that manages the simulation timeline by queuing and executing events in chronological order.</p>
        <p>Protocols: The simulator supports a wide range of protocols, allowing researchers to model different scenarios, such as TCP variants, routing protocols, and application-layer protocols.</p>
    </div>
    <div className='ns2ns3_main_div_3' data-aos="fade-down"data-aos-duration="2000">
        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>Script Creation: Users write scripts in the NS2 scripting language (based on Tcl) to define the network topology, node configurations, and protocol settings.</p>
        <p>Simulation Execution: Once the script is set up, the simulation is run. NS2 processes the events in the order they occur, updating the state of the network and generating outputs.</p>
        <p>Data Collection: As events are processed, NS2 collects data, which can later be analyzed to evaluate the performance of the network or protocols being tested.</p>
        <p>Output Analysis: Users can analyze trace files or graphical outputs (via tools like awk or MATLAB) to interpret the results, helping to identify bottlenecks or issues in the network design.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="ns2ns3_main_div_3" data-aos="fade-down"data-aos-duration="2000">
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Protocol Development: Researchers can test new protocols in controlled environments.</p>
        <p>Performance Evaluation: Users can analyze how different configurations impact network performance.</p>
        <p>Education: NS2 is often used in academic settings to teach networking concepts.</p>
    </div>
    <div className='ns2ns3_main_div_4' data-aos="fade-down"data-aos-duration="2000">
        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>Complexity: NS2 has a steep learning curve, especially for those unfamiliar with scripting.</p>
        <p>Scalability: While powerful, it may struggle with extremely large-scale simulations.</p>
        <p>Deprecation: NS2 is gradually being replaced by NS3, which offers improved features and usability.</p>
    </div>
    <div className='ns2ns3_main_div_5' data-aos="fade-down"data-aos-duration="2000">
        <h2>NS3:</h2>
        <p>Scheduling Process: NS3 scheduling involves managing the transmission of packets on a node's interface. Packets are stored in queues, and schedulers determine the order in which they are transmitted. Factors like queue size, packet priorities, traffic characteristics, and network conditions influence scheduling decisions. The process involves packet arrival, scheduler selection, dequeuing, transmission, and removal.</p>
        <p>Vertical handover (VHO) in NS3 involves simulating the transition of mobile devices between different access networks. Key steps include creating network topology, devices, mobility models, applications, triggering VHO events, and analyzing performance. Factors like handover criteria, signaling, mobility models, and metrics are crucial for accurate VHO simulation.</p>
        <p>ns3 is a versatile open-source simulator for IoT networks. It supports various topologies, protocols, devices, and physical layers. It's flexible, scalable, and has a strong community.</p>
