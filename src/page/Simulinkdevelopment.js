    <h2>Simulink</h2>
    <p>Simulink is a graphical programming environment within the MATLAB software suite. It's primarily used for modelling and simulating dynamic systems. This includes applications in signal processing (e.g., filtering, equalization), communication systems (e.g., wireless networks), power systems (e.g., grid stability), and biological systems (e.g., neural networks). Simulink offers a visual interface with pre-built blocks and a powerful simulation engine, making it a valuable tool for research and development. </p>
