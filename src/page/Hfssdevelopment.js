    <h2>HFSS Development</h2>
    <p>HFSS allows user to design and analyse high-frequency components like antennas, RF circuits, and microwave devices using Finite Element Method (FEM). Most Common designed antennas are Patch Antenna, Antennas For 5G applications, MIMO antennas, Array antennas, SIW antenna and so on. HFSS allows users to compute S-parameters, Radiation pattern, Gain.</p>

   <div className='hfss_div_2' data-aos="fade-down"data-aos-duration="2000">
    <h2>3D Model: </h2>
    <p>The process begins by creating a 3D model of the antenna structure, which seems to feature a periodic array of unique shaped elements, likely for use in high-frequency applications.</p>
   </div>
   <div className='hfss_div_3' data-aos="fade-down"data-aos-duration="2000">
    <h2>Grid Construction: </h2>
    <p>Once the model is created, a mesh or grid is constructed for numerical simulations. This step involves subdividing the structure into smaller elements to solve Maxwellâ€™s equations more efficiently in simulation software like HFSS (High-Frequency Structure Simulator).</p>
   </div>
   <div className='hfss_div_4' data-aos="fade-down"data-aos-duration="2000" >
    <h2>Field Visualization: </h2>
    <p>After the meshing, electromagnetic field distributions are computed and visualized. These colour maps show how electromagnetic fields (electric or magnetic) propagate through or interact with the antenna structure, indicating key performance areas such as radiation patterns or resonances.</p>
   </div>
   <div className='hfss_div_5' data-aos="fade-down"data-aos-duration="2000">
    <h2>S-parameters: </h2>
    <p>Finally, the S-parameters are calculated and plotted, which provide crucial information about the antenna's performance, particularly its reflection and transmission coefficients over a range of frequencies. The plot shows a typical response, with dips indicating resonant frequencies.</p>
